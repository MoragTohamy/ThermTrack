<p class=Head>ASPECTJRT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Eclipse Public License - v 1.0</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS
AGREEMENT.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. DEFINITIONS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Contribution&quot; means:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code
and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>i) changes to the Program, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ii) additions to the Program;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate
from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such
Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions
do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of
software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license
agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that
distributes the Program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable
by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in
accordance with this Agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program
under this Agreement, including all Contributors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if
any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license
under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the
Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the
Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
licensed hereunder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor
grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or
other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor
disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity
based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a
condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each
Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property
rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required
to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility
to acquire that license before distributing the Program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
license set forth in this Agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. REQUIREMENTS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object
code form under its own license agreement, provided that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>b) its license agreement:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions
of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
consequential damages, such as lost profits;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>iii) states that any provisions which differ from this
Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>iv) states that source code for the Program is available
from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy
of the Program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices
contained within the Program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of
its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While
this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do
so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other
Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial
product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby
agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified
Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively
&quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions
brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent
caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection
with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to
any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify,
an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor
in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related
settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any
such claim at its own expense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a
commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or
offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties
are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5. NO WARRANTY</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM
IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining
the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks
associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not
limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or
interruption of operations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER
RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE
OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7. GENERAL</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without
further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights
granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
filed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate
if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming
aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement
terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as
soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this
Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
continue and survive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from
time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify
this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The
Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement
Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will
be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)
may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which
it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is
published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections
2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You
under this License</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation
is filed.</p>

part of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,
if provided along</p>

text from the Work,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be
construed as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>modifying the License.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your
modifications and may provide</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>additional or different license terms and conditions for
use, reproduction, or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
Derivative Works as a whole,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the
Work otherwise complies</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with the conditions stated in this License.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5. Submission of Contributions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
intentionally submitted</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be
under the terms and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>conditions of this License, without any additional terms or
conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN>Preamble</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The licenses for most software are designed to
take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General
Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>This license, the
Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software
packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other
authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first
think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public
License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the
explanations below. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>When we speak of free
software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public
Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute
copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you
receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the
software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed
that you can do these things. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>To protect your
rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these
rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to
certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if
you modify it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>For example, if you
distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give
the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they,
too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the
library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they
can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and
recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>We protect your
rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer
you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the library. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>To protect each
distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the
free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on,
the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so
that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that
might be introduced by others. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>Finally, software
patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to
make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free
program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we
insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>Most GNU software,
including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public
License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to
certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General
Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit
linking those libraries into non-free programs. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>When a program is
linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the
combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the
original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such
linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser
General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>We call this license
the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it does Less to protect
the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides
other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free
programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public
License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in
certain special circumstances. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>For example, on rare
occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of
a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this,
non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that
a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software
only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>In other cases,
permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater
number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission
to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use
the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>Although the Lesser
General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure
that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and
the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>The precise terms and
conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close
attention to the difference between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and
a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived from
the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to
run. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>TERMS AND CONDITIONS
FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri","sans-serif"'>0.</span></strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>
This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party
saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public
License (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as
&quot;you&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>A &quot;library&quot;
means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be
conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those
functions and data) to form executables. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>The
&quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work which
has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the Library&quot;
means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to
say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
&quot;modification&quot;.) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>&quot;Source
code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code
for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>Activities other than
copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they
are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not
restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute
a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool
for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what
the program that uses the Library does. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri","sans-serif"'>1.</span></strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along
with the Library. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>You may charge a fee
for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer
warranty protection in exchange for a fee. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri","sans-serif"'>2.</span></strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>
You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions: </span></p>

that you changed the files and the date of any change.</span></p>

"Calibri","sans-serif"'>  c)</span></strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:

all third parties under the terms of this License.</span></p>

"Calibri","sans-serif"'>  d)</span></strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:
11.0pt'> If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table
of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other
than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a
good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply
such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part
of its purpose remains meaningful. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>(For example, a
function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely
well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires
that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be
optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must
still compute square roots.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>These requirements
apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work
are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent
and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when
you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and
thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>Thus, it is not the
intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written
entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the
distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>In addition, mere
aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with
a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium
does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri","sans-serif"'>3.</span></strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>
You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the
ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If
a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has
appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make
any other change in these notices. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>Once this change is
made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU
General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works
made from that copy. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>This option is useful
when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is
not a library. </span></p>

You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>If distribution of
object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then
offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place
satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third
parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri","sans-serif"'>5.</span></strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>
A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is
called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is
not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of
this License. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>However, linking a
&quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library creates an executable
that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the
Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable
is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution
of such executables. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>When a &quot;work
that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file that is part of
the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the
Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially
significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is
itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by
law. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>If such an object
file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and
small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the
use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a
derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>Otherwise, if the
work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the
work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also
fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library
itself. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri","sans-serif"'>6.</span></strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>
As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a
&quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a work
containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of
your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the
customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt'>You must give
prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and
that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a
copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices,
you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a
reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were
used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and,
if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
machine-readable &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or
source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce
a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that
the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not
necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified
definitions.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking
with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy
of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than
copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly
with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as
the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was
made with.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection
6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access
to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
specified materials from the same place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of
these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>For an executable, the required form of the
&quot;work that uses the Library&quot; must include any data and utility
programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special
exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>It may happen that this requirement
contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not
normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri","sans-serif"'>7.</span></strong><span lang=EN> You may place library
facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single
library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and
distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of
the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same
work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This
must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the
fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to
find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri","sans-serif"'>8.</span></strong><span lang=EN> You may not copy,
modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,
link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri","sans-serif"'>9.</span></strong><span lang=EN> You are not required
to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else
grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative
works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its
terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or
works based on it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri","sans-serif"'>10.</span></strong><span lang=EN> Each time you
redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient
automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and
conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise
of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
by third parties with this License. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri","sans-serif"'>11.</span></strong><span lang=EN> If, as a consequence
of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other
reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether
by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you
cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not
permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy
both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
Library. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>If any portion of this section is held invalid
or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section
is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>It is not the purpose of this section to
induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest
validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by
public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the
wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on
consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide
if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>This section is intended to make thoroughly
clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri","sans-serif"'>12.</span></strong><span lang=EN> If the distribution
and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents
or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the
Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in
or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:

License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the
present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Each version is given a distinguishing version
number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies
to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the
terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published
by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license
version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software

will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all

<p class=MsoNormal>      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
constitutes direct</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent

<p class=MsoNormal>          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry
prominent notices</p>

Derivative Works</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>          that You distribute, all copyright, patent,
trademark, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>          attribution notices from the Source form of the
Work,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
part of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>          the Derivative Works; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text
file as part of its</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You
distribute must</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices
contained</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
that do not</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at
least one</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
distributed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source
form or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>          documentation, if provided along with the
Derivative Works; or,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works,
if and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
The contents</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes
only and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own
attribution</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>          notices within Derivative Works that You
distribute, alongside</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the
Work, provided</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be
construed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>          as modifying the License.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your
modifications and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      may provide additional or different license terms and
conditions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
modifications, or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided
Your use,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise
complies with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      the conditions stated in this License.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly
state otherwise,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion
in the Work</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
conditions of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      this License, without any additional terms or
conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
supersede or modify</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may
have executed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to
use the trade</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of
the Licensor,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in
describing the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the
NOTICE file.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
law or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and
each</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS
IS&quot; BASIS,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either
express or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties
or conditions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
FITNESS FOR A</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
determining the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work
and assume any</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
under this License.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no
legal theory,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
otherwise,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
and grossly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any
Contributor be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      liable to You for damages, including any direct,
indirect, special,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      result of this License or out of the use or inability
to use the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of
goodwill,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
and all</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such
Contributor</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
redistributing</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
to offer,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
indemnity,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      or other liability obligations and/or rights
consistent with this</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
may act only</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility,
not on behalf</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to
indemnify,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
liability</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
Contributor by reason</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional
liability.</p>
